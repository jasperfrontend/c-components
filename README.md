# c-components

These components will be used in a tool I am creating that allows streamers 
to create awesome promotional images for their live streams with very little effort.

Streamers can pick from gorgeous pre-made components to create a promo graphic that is ready
for sharing on any social media platform that supports 9/16 graphics (Instagram stories, Twitch Stories, Tiktok, Facebook even).

## This repository contains the current components

Built with [Vue3](https://vuejs.org), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) and [Open Props](https://open-props.style/).
